        "The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before.", 
        "Software is like entropy: It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics; i.e., it always increases.",
        "Software is a gas; it expands to fill its container.",

        "The best way to get accurate information on Usenet is to post something wrong and wait for corrections.",

        "Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren’t doing anything.  One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them.  Very often they’re sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space.  What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.",
        "If you think you are worth what you know, you are very wrong.  Your knowledge today does not have much value beyond a couple of years.  Your value is what you can learn and how easily you can adapt to the changes this profession brings so often.",
        "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.",

        "Low-level programming is good for the programmer’s soul.",
        "It’s OK to figure out murder mysteries, but you shouldn’t need to figure out code.  You should be able to read it.",

        "If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.",
        "How rare it is that maintaining someone else’s code is akin to entering a beautifully designed building, which you admire as you walk around and plan how to add a wing or do some redecorating.
